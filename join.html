									<h3>Let's Play Tennis!</h3>
									<h2>Join Coach Clara Tennis</h2>
									<p>We're teaching a life-long sport and building great adults through enoucragment and expectations of behavior on court. CCT focuses on having fun on the court while learning proper form and the rules of tennis. Depending on the child’s tennis background and ability, we go over several different drills that promote footwork, correct form and sportsmanship.</p>
									<br>
									<p>Our clinics promote rallying, strategy, and communication skills with a partner. Our private lessons follow that same structure, but with an emphasis on technical form.

						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
							<div class="expand-collapse">
							<h3>What to bring!</h3>
							<div>
								<p>We're outside and exposed to many elements. I recommend bringing a hat, sunglasses, ice water, proper tennis shoes, and your own racket to tennis practice. As well as putting on sunscreen before class begins, especially during the summer. In the winter, as Floridians, we can forget that we need to layer. I suggest making sure your child has an extra jacket and a warm hat to wear for those extra cold days.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>Where are the lessons?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>We coach at courts at the beaches to Hodges blvd. There are some clinics in Mandarin as well.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>How do we communicate for lessons?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>For private lessons, we will communicate through text or Facebook Messenger. For clinics, I use Facebook Groups to communicate to everyone at once. In there, I post announcements and polls for upcoming clinics. To sign up for the clinic, you fill out the poll and you're signed up! Please let me know in advance if you're unable to come to practice.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>How do private lessons work?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Private lessons are for those who want to hone a skill, advance faster or looking for one-on-one instruction. We're able to tailor the lesson according to the child's needs and wants. For consistency, it's expected to agree to a weekly lesson and plan for a makeup if weather cancels the lesson.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>How do clinics work?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Tennis clinics are groups of four tennis players or more. They begin with a stretch, dynmanic warmup, groundstrokes, volleys, serves, and then we move onto point games or matches.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>Where should I buy tennis gear?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>Go Pro Tennis! We belive that whenever you can, support your local stores. Go Pro Tennis has everything you need from tennis clothes, tennis rackets, strings to restring your rackets, tennis shoes, grips etc. They have stores on St. John's Bluff and in Mandarin. www.goprotennis.com </p>
							</div>
							<h3>What racket size should I buy?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>A general rule for children's rackets is to see if the child can firmly grasp the grip when standing upright and the racket head in on the ground. Wilson Tennis Camps created a great article with an easy to read chart that I find helpful. https://www.wilsontenniscamps.com/finding-the-right-sized-racket/</p>

							</div>
							<h3>Who do you recommend for adult lessons?</h3>
							<div>
								<p>We're strictly children tennis coaches, however, we know of some great adult coaches to refer you to. We can reccommend tennis coaches at the beaches, Mandarin, Julington Creek, Downtown, Fernandina Beach and Yulee. Send us an inquiry on the contact page and we'll provide their contact information.</p>
