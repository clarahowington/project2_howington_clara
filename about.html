								<h3>Hey There!</h3>
								<h2>I'm Clara Howington</h2>
								<p>Let me introduce myself. I’m a tennis player turned tennis coach. I saw a need for a fun, understanding, and supportive kid’s coach in Jacksonville like the ones I had growing up.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>I fell in love with tennis at six years old. I had an amazing coach with a whimsical personality who made every tennis lesson fun. My tennis jourey led me through college tennis, club tennis and now coaching. Along the way I've created a cherished community in Jacksonville, Florida.

								<h2>Coaching Philosophy.</h2>
								<p>I believe that a child will play tennis throughout their life if they love being on the tennis court. Fun and form is the center of every practice. As well, we cover aspects of a well-rounded life during every practice.</p>

							<div class="listitems">
								<ul>
									<li><p>Encourage good behavior and drive to learn</p></li>
									<li><p>Hold students to a realistic standard</p></li>
									<li><p>Promote a healthy life mentally and physically</p></li>

								<h2>Let's Get Personal.</h2>
								<p>I'm from Fernandina Beach, Florida and one of four children. We grew up as wild homeschoolers who didn't wear shoes most of the day and ran free throughout our neighborhood. Our family loves animals and our backyard was known to look like a barnyard. Today I have a one-eyed dog, a cross-eyed cat, and a giant goldfish.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Growing up, my life revolved around church and tennis. Not much has changed since then! While the way that I'm invovled has shifted, they're still just as important. I've come to realize that a relationship with Jesus first and being curious enough to ask questions is more satisfying than simply going to a building. For tennis, stepping back from training and teaching children tennis has changed the way I think about the game.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Aside from coaching, I'm focusing on getting a master's degree in web design from UF and learning from others. If you've seen me around town or have taken lessons from me, you're probably used to being asked questions about your career and life stories. But enough about me. . .let's connect soon so we can talk about your life!</p>
